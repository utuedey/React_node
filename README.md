# REACT-NODEJS BASIC SETUp

To connect React with Node.js, you typically use HTTP requests to communicate between the frontend (React) and the backend (Node.js). The most common way to achieve this is through RESTful API endpoints. Below are the steps to set up a basic connection between React and Node.js:

### 1. Set Up Your Node.js Server:

Create a basic Node.js server using a framework like Express. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

### Create a simple server file `server.js`:

Run your Node.js server:

```bash
node server.js
```

### 2. Create a React App:

Create a new React app using Create React App or your preferred method:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

### 3. Make HTTP Requests from React to Node.js:

Modify your React components to make HTTP requests to the Node.js server. You can use the `fetch` API or libraries like `axios`. Install axios:

```bash
npm install axios
```

Modify your `src/App.js` in the React app:

### 4. Start Your React App:

Run your React app:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if prompted) in your browser. You should see the data fetched from your Node.js server displayed in your React app.

This is a simple example, and in a real-world application, you would have more sophisticated routes, error handling, and possibly user authentication. Adjust the server and React app according to your specific requirements.
